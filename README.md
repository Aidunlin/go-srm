# Student Record Manager Project

This is a Go/[templ](https://templ.guide/) recreation of [a project I worked on in CTEC 127](https://github.com/Aidunlin/ctec127/tree/main/project-2), which was originally written in PHP. It uses the exact same MySQL database, which I've exported under the `/sql` directory.

To tinker with this project, install MySQL and run the provided SQL code. Before you `go run .` (don't forget the dot!), use `templ generate`.

You can use [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for hot-reloading, but you may have to adjust the `bin` and `cmd` properties in the `.air.toml` file.
